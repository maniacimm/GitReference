# GitReference-Project
# CSCI 490 Mobile App

Created an app that reads a json file of Git commands and displays all of the commands via a ListView. Each item in the ListView 
displays the commnad, code example, explanation. There is a small amount of spacing inbetween each list item and the list is scrollable.
The WOW factor is creating a filter by section.
